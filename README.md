# DonateNOW 
**DonateNOW** is a simple, responsive website designed to raise awareness about the war in Ukraine and provide information about where to donate money and find volunteer opportunities. While the donation system is implemented only as a demonstration and does not process real payments, the information about charities and volunteer opportunities is accurate.
